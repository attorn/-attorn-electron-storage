## Getting started

#### The `@attorm/electron-storage` package
The `@attorm/electron-storage` package is a really light, simple and convenient package that has been implemented for use in the `Attorn` project. 
Because the `Attorn` project has a significant number of different packages, and in some of them file storage was used, we built this package to use it where needed in the `Attorn` project.

You can also use it in your electron projects by reading these documents and understanding how `@attorm/electron-storage` works.
